<p>if you&#8217;ve setup port forwarding but you cannot see the content that the flask server is supposedly serving on port 5000, even though ports like 80 or 22 are working it might be because (as outlined in the docs) flask, by default, serves only on the localhost.</p>

<p>VBoxManage.exe modifyvm &#8220;VMnameInQuotes&#8221; &#8211;natpf1 &#8220;guestFlask,tcp,,5555,,5000&#8221;</p>

<p>if you check netstat -nao  while the server is running you&#8217;ll see a line like this (amoung other things, you could also use netstat -nao | grep 5000)
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5000          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      off (0.00/0/0)</p>

<p>to be able to load the app on that port in your host machine you will need to follow the following steps
first stop the server</p>

<p>then change your</p>

<p>app.run()</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>app.run(host=&#8221;0.0.0.0&#8221;)</p>

<p>and restart the server</p>

<p>netstat -nao should now show
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      off (0.00/0/0)</p>

<p>and you should be able to access the guest server from the host using localhost:5555 (or whatever other port you forwarded it to)</p>
